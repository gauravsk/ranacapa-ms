Environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding is becoming a core tool in biodiversity monitoring and conservation, and is a promising way to go beyond species inventory to systems-level analyses of community ecological dynamics. Results from eDNA analyses can inform and inspire research scientists, natural resource managers, students, community scientists, and naturalists; however, there is a dearth of easily accessible data exploration tools for this diverse audience. Here we present the R package ranacapa, at the core of which is a Shiny web-app that helps perform exploratory biodiversity analyses and visualizations of eDNA results. The web-app accepts multiple formats of taxonomy tables, and requires a simple metadata file with descriptive information about each sample. The app allows users to explore the data with interactive figures for instant community ecology analysis. We demonstrate the usability of ranacapa by multiple user groups, including the National Park Service, a public community science program, and an undergraduate microbiology course.
